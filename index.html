        <h1 class="ff-serif fs-300" style="clear:both">The Detroit Techno Scene</h1>

        <p class="ff-sans-italic fs-100">I actually wanted to call this music high tech soul from the very beginning. 
            I never wanted to call it techno. Thats what I thought it should have been called. But nobody liked it, so... &#8208;Derrick May</p>
    

        <h2 class="ff-serif fs-200">Origin</h2>

        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">
            A shared deep love of music, sparked a musical group composed of Derrick May, Juan Atkins, and Kevin Saunderson. 
            Together, they would eventually become known as the “Belleville Three” and lay down the blueprint for techno music.
        </p>

        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">
            The early techno records from the Detroit scene were ignored in Michigan but tracks like Rythim Is Rythim's Strings Of Life, 
            Model 500's No UFOs and Inner City's Good Life were gaining traction in Europe's club culture.

        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">
            Detroit, a shining example of the futuristic megametroplis many can hope for was beginning to lose its lustre around the 70s. 
            Detroit's three big car companies were moving out of the city in search of cheaper land. 
            Those that could afford to leave the city did and those that couldn't were abondoned.
        </p>

        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">The abondoned youth, well aware of their circumstances, craved an escape. And that escape came to be techno music.</p>
        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">With decaying Detroit as a muse, the resulting sound of techno is a minimal, soulful melancholy.</p>

        <h2 class="ff-serif fs-200">Influences</h2>
        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">The Electrifying Mojo, a radio DJ personality based in Detroit, played a large role in influencing the Bellview Three's music.</p>
        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">Charles Johnson, the man behind the radio name, is largely known to play a broad selection of music ranging from American funk music to European electronic music.</p>
        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">Sonically speaking, Detroit techno was the synthesis of what The Electrifying Mojo played on his radio station. The Bellview Three have credited the radio station for putting them on to artists like P-Funk, Kraftwerk, and Michael Henderson. </p>
        <p class="ff-sans-normal fs-100">Kraftwerk, a European electronic/new wave band, put Germany on the map for the trio.</p>
